# Senior Backend Engineering Concepts with NestJS

This document outlines various backend concepts that we'll implement in our NestJS application.

## Core Concepts

1. **Dependency Injection & IoC**

   - Constructor-based injection
   - Property-based injection
   - Custom providers
   - Provider scopes (Singleton, Request, Transient)

2. **Caching Strategies**

   - In-memory caching
   - Redis caching
   - Cache invalidation
   - Cache-aside pattern
   - Cache decorators

3. **Database Patterns**

   - Repository pattern
   - Unit of Work pattern
   - Database transactions
   - Optimistic locking
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization

4. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - JWT implementation
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - OAuth2 integration
   - Session management
   - Password hashing & salting

5. **API Design**

   - RESTful best practices
   - GraphQL implementation
   - API versioning
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - Response serialization

6. **Error Handling**

   - Global exception filters
   - Custom exceptions
   - Error logging
   - Error response standardization
   - Validation pipes

7. **Performance Optimization**

   - Response compression
   - Streaming responses
   - Lazy loading
   - Pagination
   - Query optimization

8. **Testing**

   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - E2E testing
   - Test containers
   - Mocking & stubbing

9. **Logging & Monitoring**

   - Structured logging
   - Log levels
   - Request tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Health checks

10. **Message Queues & Background Jobs**

    - Bull queue implementation
    - Job scheduling
    - Worker processes
    - Retry mechanisms
    - Dead letter queues

11. **Security**

    - CORS configuration
    - Helmet integration
    - Rate limiting
    - SQL injection prevention
    - XSS protection

12. **Microservices Concepts**
    - Service discovery
    - Circuit breakers
    - Load balancing
    - API Gateway pattern
    - Event-driven architecture

## Implementation Plan

We'll implement these concepts incrementally, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced patterns. Each implementation will include:

1. Working code example
2. Unit tests
3. Documentation
4. Best practices
5. Common pitfalls to avoid

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── modules/           # Feature modules
├── common/           # Shared code, utilities, and helpers
├── config/           # Configuration files
├── core/            # Core functionality (auth, logging, etc.)
├── interfaces/      # TypeScript interfaces
└── main.ts         # Application entry point
```

## Getting Started

Each concept will be implemented in its own branch and merged into main after review. This allows for isolated learning and testing of each concept.
