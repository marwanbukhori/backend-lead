# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview

This section covers the event-driven architecture principles and implementation in our learning platform.

## Core Components

### Event Bus

- NestJS event bus implementation
- Event publishing and subscription
- Event handling patterns

### Message Queues

- Bull queue integration
- Job processing
- Retry mechanisms
- Error handling

### Event Handlers

```typescript
// Example Event Handler
@EventHandler(CourseCreatedEvent)
export class CourseCreatedHandler {
  async handle(event: CourseCreatedEvent) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Asynchronous Processing

- Background job processing
- Scheduled tasks
- Long-running operations

## Best Practices

- Event versioning
- Error handling and recovery
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization

## Implementation Examples

- Course creation workflow
- User notification system
- Content processing pipeline
